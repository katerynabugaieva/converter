## improvements that you would make if you had more time
If I had more time, I prefer do next steps:
- make whole components absolutely abstract and non related
- improve architecture structure including dom components, helpers, utils etc
- refactor the code, add class for functional components
- add verification for inputs of number to exchange
- add unitests, covering 100% of app
- add verification for link
- add short database with data on date

## your workflow and how much time you approximately spent on the different parts
For making this code challenge I spent according 20 working hours,  first I made a working prototype that meets the task
the rest of the time I spent on separting components or replacing them with material-ui
